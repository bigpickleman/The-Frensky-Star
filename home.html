After hearing the news, many Arthur fans were worried that PBS would no longer play reruns, but it was later Confirmed by Erin Callanan, WGBH Director of Media Relations that reruns would continue. Callanan said “I think the most important thing to note is that Arthur isn’t going away. Arthur will continue to air on PBS KIDS for years.”
<br>
<br> But don't worry Arthur fans, there is still plenty to look forward to! The Arthur Finale Season will officially begin on August 7th, when the Arthur exhibition at the Fenimore Art Museum opens. This exhibition will give us an inside look at Marc Brown's artwork, and creative process in creating his books and the Arthur show. The Museum is located in Cooperstown, NY, and will be on display until December 31, 2021. Children ages 19 and under will recieve free admission!
<br>
<br> Finale season will continue on Labor Day as the final Arthur special, "Arthur's First Day" will premiere! In this episode, Arthur will be entering the fourth grade, and be figuring out how to navigate himself throughout the school year.
<br>
<br>On January 11, 2022, the final Arthur book titled <i>Believe in Yourself: What We Learned From Arthur</i> will be released! This is a "big book" and took a while to make said author Marc Brown in his <i>Democracy for Dinosaurs</i> virtual book release. The book will be nearly 130 pages, and is expected to reflect on the entire book series, as well as the show. The book is available for <a href="https://www.lbyr.com/titles/marc-brown/believe-in-yourself-what-we-learned-from-arthur/9780759554566/#:~:text=As%20the%20award%2Dwinning%20Arthur,for%20graduations%20and%20other%20milestones!">pre-order now</a> from several online retailers.
