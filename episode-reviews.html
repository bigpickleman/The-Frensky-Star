 <b>Season 1 Episode 1a</b>
 <br> 
 From the beginning to the end, this is a classic episode of Arthur. The opening scene immediatly draws in the viewer as the camera zooms into the Read's house. And who could forget the opening line to this amazing series spoken by none other D.W. Read. The entire episode follows the story about how Arthur got his glasses. Which is a perfect opening story, seeing how Arthur's glasses are so iconic. Once Arthur gets his glasses he wears them to school, and then we get to see his friend's reaction to his new look. The reactions to Arthur's glasses are not only hilarious, but are the exact way that an average elementary student would react to a kid who just got glasses. <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/SxaNKs3.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> This is very relatable to my experiences at school. The joke lines in this episode also hit just perfect. There is not one line in this episode that I would rewrite for Buster, Francine, D.W. or Binky. At the end, we see Arthur resolve his problem of getting teased by comparing him to someone that all kids admire, Wilber Rabbit (Bionic Bunny). I think that this is the perfect way that the writers ended this episode, and it shows kids how to deal with getting teased for what they wear or do. Lastly, I love the background music throughout this entire episode. It is not the traditional Arthur score that plays throughout this episode, instead it is mysterious music, with lots of organs. This completely brings a new life an atmosphere throughout the episode.
<br>
<br> There is not too much that I didn't like from this episode. It is a very solid opening to the series that introduces many characters from the series. I will say, one small detail that bothered me in this episode is the continuity of Sue Ellen. As you may know, later in the series it is revealed that she moved to Elwood City during the 4th grade school year, but this episode takes place when Arthur is still in 3rd. I would also have liked them to come up with a more creative way for Arthur to get an eye test, because I don't really think yearly eye tests are given to the whole school. But overall very great episode!
