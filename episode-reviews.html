 <b>Season 1 Episode 1a</b>
 <br> 
 From the beginning to the end, this is a classic episode of Arthur. The opening scene immediatly draws in the viewer as the camera zooms into the Read's house. And who could forget the opening line to this amazing series spoken by none other D.W. Read. The entire episode follows the story about how Arthur got his glasses. Which is a perfect opening story, seeing how Arthur's glasses are so iconic. Once Arthur gets his glasses he wears them to school, and then we get to see his friend's reaction to his new look. The reactions to Arthur's glasses are not only hilarious, but are the exact way that an average elementary student would react to a kid who just got glasses. <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/SxaNKs3.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> This is very relatable to my experiences at school. The joke lines in this episode also hit just perfect. There is not one line in this episode that I would rewrite for Buster, Francine, D.W. or Binky. At the end, we see Arthur resolve his problem of getting teased by comparing him to someone that all kids admire, Wilber Rabbit (Bionic Bunny). I think that this is the perfect way that the writers ended this episode, and it shows kids how to deal with getting teased for what they wear or do. Lastly, I love the background music throughout this entire episode. It is not the traditional Arthur score that plays throughout this episode, instead it is mysterious music, with lots of organs. This completely brings a new life an atmosphere throughout the episode.
<br>
<br> There is not too much that I didn't like from this episode. It is a very solid opening to the series that introduces many characters from the series. I will say, one small detail that bothered me in this episode is the continuity of Sue Ellen. As you may know, later in the series it is revealed that she moved to Elwood City during the 4th grade school year, but this episode takes place when Arthur is still in 3rd. I would also have liked them to come up with a more creative way for Arthur to get an eye test, because I don't really think yearly eye tests are given to the whole school. But overall very great episode!

 <b>Season 1 Episode 1b</b>
 <br> The Second half of episode one is yet another classic. And it is all about my favorite character, Francine! I personally think that the writers are pure genious in this episode, because we get lots of character developement that will last throughout the entire series. Starting with the cold open, we learn that Muffy likes to be very fashionable. The episode proper begins with a kickball game, in which we learn that the Arthur and Francine's 3rd grade class is battle the 4th graders in kickball. This is something that I relate to very much, as my 3rd grade class was always competing against the 4th graders in everything (and lost most of the time). <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/bWQ7jM9.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> We then learn that Francine is the MVP of the 3rd grade team, and players like Arthur and Buster aren't too athletic at all. It's crazy how this one minute opening scene tells us so much about the characters. The episode then goes on to show how Muffy gives Francine a makeover for the school pictures that are coming up. After her makeover, Buster has one of the best lines of the entire series when Francine asks him if he likes her new hairdo. I'm not going to tell you it, you just have to watch for yourself! Yet again, the writers come through this episode with several amazing jokes. In the end this episode has an amazing moral, to be yourself. The moral isn't at all too obvious for kids, but that is what makes Arthur so amazing.
<br>
<br>Not too many critiscisms for this episode either. One thing that I really hated about this episode was that Prunella (one of my least favorite characters), kept trying to act all prim and perfect like muffy. Even though she pretty sabotaged her picture on purposed the year before when she rubbed her feet on the carpet (as seen in cold open). Another incredible episode, as is possibly the best episode pairing within the entire series.

 <b>Season 1 Episode 2a</b>
 <br> Yet another classic episode that is based on one of the bestselling Arthur books, "Arthur's Teacher Trouble." Overall the episode pretty much resembles the book. One of the things to this episodes that stands out to me in particular in this episode is the reactions of the characters. We also get a lot of background information about the students and teachers at Lakewood Elementary. <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/VaQ04wx.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">And overall, great message within this episode for time management. Even though this message is made a little more direct than most episodes of Arthur, I do not mind it. Lastly, this episode has great animation, which is something I haven't metioned in the other two reviews. The animation is normally spot on within the first seasons of Arthur. But this episode just spot on with their reactions and everything. There is not too many jokes and gags within this episode, but this is the first appearance of the "Sorry Sir" running joke that everyone says to Mr. Haney, which I really enjoyed.
<br>
<br>As I was rewatching this episode, I noticed that I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. It ran through the story much slower than I remember, but I imagine that this episode would be a lot more entertaining for younger kids.

 <b>Season 1 Episode 2b</b>
 <br> Who could forget one of the most memorable songs from the entire series. Anyone who watches this episode will have <em>a-a-r-d-v-a-r-k</em> stuck in their head for hours! I remember watching this episode with my family during my preparation for a school geography bee. I thought I was so cool, standing up there just like Arthur did. Maybe I have a personal connection, but this episode is definetly <em>Arthur</em> at it's finest. <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/tdn5OtC.gif"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">I don't know what it is, but whenever I watch this episode, I always feel so good! Throughout the episode, the main message is to persevere and try your hardest at what you do.  And in the end for Arthur it paid off! The writers are so good at establishing Arthur as a likable character that the audience can instantly relate to. They then utilize Prunella (who I usually don't like) as the antagonist in this episode, and it totally works. Besides the main message in the story, there are several other sub-morals here. The biggest one being to not be over confident with yourself (In Brain and Prunella's cases). You also may notice several little easter eggs in this episode, like the cheezy doodle chips that Kate is eating, and Abbey Road being featured in Arthur's dictionary. Lastly, an Arthur episode cannot be perfect without the gags, and there are several in this episode. Most coming from D.W., but others are subtly added in. Such as the <em>glooba</em> joke coming from Baby Kate. 
<br> 
<br> This episode is pure genious and I wouldn't want to change a thing about it! No flaws or anthing. The only thing that I didn't understand is that The Brain could give a crack at spelling antidisestablishmentarianism, but couldn't spell fear. Well I guess that's what happens when we crack under pressure!

 <b>Season 1 Episode 3a</b>
<br> This is one of the few episodes of the season that I did not recognize by the title. Nevertheless, it is a great episode that I enjoy watching everytime. Out of the episodes I've reviewed so far, this one has possibly the best cold open. How D.W. acts here is what everyone first thinks of her, as a whiny 4 year old. However, the writers don't make this cold open annoying to the viewer, but entertaining, as they provide an important backstory as to why D.W. is upset.<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/UiaeOXF.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> The episode opens with D.W. and her classmates at the aquarium. Honestly, episodes that feature D.W. with her friends are a hit or miss with me. This one falls right in between. The bathroom scene with all the preschoolers is pretty hilarious, but what I don't get is how D.W. is scared of an octopus but not sharks or electric eels. One thing that this episode does really great is make Arthur look like a real trouble-maker, which he generally isn't. When they get to the beach D.W. doesn't want to play in the water, and  Mom and Dad actually force Arthur to play with D.W. since she won't go in the water. This kind of annoyed me, because everyone was telling her that their wasn't any octopuses in the water. So basically she was ruining the beach trip by not going in the water and moping. One gag that we get in this episode is that Buster is forced to wear a pink bathing cap with flowers on it. This also is the first time we get to see hints of Mrs. Baxter being overprotective of Buster. As the lifegaurd said she send the swimcap by a messanger. In the end it's a pretty good moral and story, but the least favorite of the one's I have reviewed so far.

 <b>Season 1 Episode 3b</b>
<br> Here is another classic Arthur episode that is always getting referenced throughout the series. The episode starts out with a very interesting cold open, as it compares Francine's interest to basketball to Buster's interest in dinosaurs. I found this comparison strange but it kind of works. Throughout this whole episode, Arthur's class goes on a field trip. I normally enjoy when Arthur's class goes on field trips such as episodes like "The Cave." <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/sNJa1vJ.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> One thing that I did not like was how immature Arthur's class acted when they got off the bus and at the dinosaur presentation. I get that they are only eight, but one of the parts of the series that I enjoy so much is how the characters act older then they really are. The writers also did a great job making Buster look like the smart in this episode, which I really applauded and thought was funny. This just goes to show you that Buster can do many things if he's interested and puts his mind to it. Overall the story has a pretty good plot that holds through until the end. I would have liked to hear the reaction of Ranger Ruth when Arthur and Buster returned the fossil, but it worked out in the end. Still a pretty great episode, not as strong as the others, but pretty good.

 <b>Season 1 Episode 4a</b>
<br> A very sweet episide, that is full of jokes and gags throughout the entire episode. This episode truly makes me like the older D.W. episodes more than the newer ones. We also see more of Buster's mom being overprotective of him, when D.W. warns him that he should be home for dinner. <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/bghY5M9.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">  One thing that this episode does a great job of doing is showing how Arthur gets easily embarrassed by D.W., and this continues throughout the entire series. I also like how Arthur tries to outsmart D.W to not bring Nadine to WonderWorld. This is overall a good classic introduction to Nadine. I also thought it was so sweet at the end when D.W. gave Arthur the orange tickets to go on the Hurl-a-Wurl. Also a pretty funny ending where they go on the bumper cars (or know as bumpy boots in the future), and Arthur get;s sandwiched by D.W. and Buster. I thought that was a pretty great touch for the end of the episode Overall a pretty good episode but not a fantastic one.
