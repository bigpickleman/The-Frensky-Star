 <b>Season 5 Episode 3b</b>
 <br>
 <br>To quote Uncle Fred from Arthur's Perfect Christmas, <img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/4KBQE5e.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">"Sometimes, you don't get what you want in life: sometimes you get something better," and that's what this episode is all about as well. In this case, Aqualand is where everyone wants to go. I'd be willing to bet that Aqualand is a parody of Cedar Point, a famous amusement park on the Lake Erie shoreline in Ohio where I'm sure Marc Brown went as a kid, about 2 ½ hours down I-90 from his hometown of Erie, PA. Or it could've been a parody of Noah's Ark in Wisconsin, the largest waterpark in America, which I had the pleasure of going to on vacation when I was younger. Marine World, where Mr. Read has home movies of them going to as a kid, definitely looks like a more quaint and less tourist-trappy park that could be at the waterfront near a smaller beach along the Jersey Shore. Although Arthur and his friends are upset that there was no amusement park, what they find looks like one of the best-kept secrets of their area: a beach without the glamour and tourist traps: just nature and sea creatures. 
<br>
<br>There's not much more to say about this episode other than that this trip was a great idea from Mr. Read. He nixed what probably would've been an unglamorous trip at a crowded tourist trappy amusement park and encouraged the kids to just explore and enjoy nature, where they were the only ones there. Except, of course, for the sea creatures they found, like hermit crabs, sea stars, kelp, sea anemones, and a dolphin. And Mr. Ratburn, of course, who Sue Ellen mistook for a shark and who seemed like he was only there for educational purposes. This episode is proof that you don't need a Gift Galleon, Polar Coaster, Squid Scrambler, or a Deluxe Great White Sharkade to have a good time–just an open mind and a beach. Ocean Zone should be preserved at all costs, because the people living in that area deserve a place where they can enjoy the beach, without the tourist trappy stuff that the beach in Arthur’s Family Vacation had. 
<br>
<br>When nobody wants to go home at the end of the day, you know that it’s a good trip.
