 <b>Special #6</b>
 <br> 
<br> With the holiday season right around the corner, the Arthur team has given us a special Thanksgiving treat.<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/MS2ca07.gif"  width="500" height="200" position="right" style="float:right"> The brand new special "<i>An Arthur Thanksgiving</i>" is presented as a magical mess of your dreams, that is hard to follow yet entertaining. The beginning of the episode sets the tone for the chaotic atmosphere, and what better way to do that then have Dad Read cooking in the kitchen. We also a nearly 8 minute scene in the kitchen here which I found was completed in a very interesting and creative way. Once Aunt Minnie arrives is when you need to start really focusing to get the full affect of this episode. As there are three our four clear plot lines that can often get intertwined and tangled together in your first viewing. It is pretty clear that this is the introduction that Aunt Minnie, and what a great one it is. But before we get to Aunt Minnie, we get the introduction to probably the most boring and unoriginal plot line of this episode. Pal is tied down outside and gets cut lose and chases Francine's cat Nemo. Despite the animal plot in this story being the worst part in this episode, I do have to say that I did transition into Tony Daniels new voice acting of Nemo very well. It sounds almost like the Late Greg Kramer, who did a fabulous job voicing Nemo. In this plot of the story, Pal runs away while chasing Nemo. I found this the very unbelievable, because Pal has chased Nemo in several other episodes down the street and has found his way back home. Not to mention Pal also gets lost downtown in "Arthur's Lost Dog." However, we do get an introduction to several other characters because of Pal getting lost. Such as characters like Mrs. Prendergast (who was seen for only a few moments back in season 21), Nicky (a dog at the shelter), Petunia (random dog), and Sharina (Street Vendor). The character that I found most facinating was Sharina. It isn't too often we get an introduction to a Hispanic character in Arthur, and I loved Sharina's warm and friendly personality and willingness to help. I really hope that she gets to be featured in another episode in an upcoming season. However we do get an introduction to a pretty dull charcater as Pal is running away, and that is of course Petunia. I really thought that it would have been a great opportunity to make Pal get in even more trouble when Petunia offered him some of the Thanksgiving meal. I was very confused when she just let Pal go to town on those tortellini without cornering him and getting him in trouble. Petunia didn't show anything too special throughout the rest of the episode either, but was just average. I don't see the creation of Petunia into the Arthur universe as a total let down. She is as sweet dog with a very kind heart, but I just viewed her as a missed opportunity for the writers.
 <br>
 <br>The second plot of the story is this strange Thanksgiving parade that is occuring in Elwood City. Not to mention the 3rd grade class's float is just ridiculous, but yet amusing. As soon as Arthur mentioned that his class was going to do a parade float based on <i>Hickory Dickory Dock</i>, I was so confused on what this parade was. Then when I actually saw the parade portion of the episode, I realized that this had some of the funniest parts of the special entirely. Buster with a great line about putting his make-up on without a mirror, and Binky with his vampire mouse costume. Then we have the run through of this ill-planned out parade float with Francine flapping her wings like s bird, the bell props being used not fitting in with the float, and all of the kids so confused about what is happening. Definetley the greatest part of this special comes within this short two minute segment here.
 <br>
 <br>After the parade practice, Arthur decides to go out and join the search party for Pal. It is here where we get another great appearance, and this time it's of Mr. Ratburn's husband Patrick. I love how they did this subtle little appearance of Patrick without making an entire production out of it. I really hope that he also get's more appearances in episodes. Then we get to what's happening at the Read's home during all of this. I think that this introduction episode to Aunt Minnie has actually left me more puzzeled about her before I watched it. Like what happened between this Thanksgiving special and <i> The Rhythm & Roots</i> episode. Also, I really don't see why D.W. and her have such a great relationship at the end of this episode. I thought she wasn't particularly the nicest to her and Bud. However, Minnie and D.W.'s relationship seems to come together throughout the episode and works very nicely in the end. Now getting back to the dogs part of the episode, while Arthur is on a wild goose chase trying to find these dogs, Pal and Petunia run into an animal shelter and decide to bring the rest of the left over Thanksgiving food to the shelter. This was really a heart warming and was a really cute way to sum up the lackluster of a plot during the dog portion of the episode. After, Pal get's a lead from one of the dogs named Nicky on where his family is.He then runs into this bizare look alike family that look absolutley horendous. I thought that this was absolutley hilarious, as the way this family looks is so hard to describe. They look like a cross between a 70's hippie family and the "Adult Arthur" video series on YouTube.
<br>
<br> The special ends in an odd but predictable way, as Gobbler the Thanksgiving turkey gets loose and blows away while Muffy is vloging about the parade. Then Pal gets taken in by the fire department and take down Gobbler the. Despite this, the ending of the episode was great, as everyone who helped out was invited to Thanksgiving. We also get to see the nicer side of Aunt Minnie as she addopts Nicky from the shelter, which I thought was a fitting ending. Overall this is by far the craziest Arthur special to date. There is so much going on, and happening which makes it so entertaining. The animation in this episode didn't seem up to par from what we are used to from Arthur. It seemed more akin to a season 16 or early 9 Story episode. I'm not sure if that is because this was made during the pandemic, or what but the characters movements didn't flow quite like they should have. Another thing that I also enjoyed about this episode was the music. The first thing in this episode that I noticed was the <i>Ratatouille</i>-esque music that was playing at the very beginning of this episode while Mr. Read was cooking. So we got some new music, but the episode still retained the classic Arthur score that we are all used to hearing. A great Arthur episode for the Thanksgiving holiday that I encorage everyone to watch!
