 <b>Season 2 Episode 6a</b>
 <br>
 <br>There’s only one thing this episode is based on, and that’s<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/64d8UFy.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> the old folk tale “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” Here, that boy is Buster. It kind of is amazing that a disgusting-sounding ice cream flavor, Rocky Trout, from the Brain’s ice cream shop is what does the job here, but cats do tend to like fish and Alphonse might have been hungry. Maybe Mrs. Powers and the Brain should’ve gotten more credit for the rescue. It probably could’ve been really good for business (at least until people discovered the flavors). 
 <br>
 <br>It’s interesting to me how Buster originally was downplaying the rescue, but once the story got down to the newspaper, whose editor-in-chief just happened to be Mrs. Baxter, it took off. As a journalism minor from college, that is the definition of a conflict of interest. And if that story were to be put in the newspaper, it probably would’ve been better in an “oddities” section. With the notoriety that the story got, it’s understandable that Buster would be excited and want to take it in, but at the same time, his friends were right to be annoyed. The runaway piano at the end is maybe the most bizarre thing that could’ve been rolling through the street, not just because Arthur and the crew didn’t believe Buster (which is when “The Boy Who Cried Wolf” comes in), but because it’s almost impossible for a grand piano to roll anywhere unless it had a huge push. The ending with the Buster Baxter, Piano Tamer trailer is pretty funny, though (and the “21st Century Rat” production company name is genius). 
 <br>
 <br>Lots of what happened here could’ve been avoided if Mrs. Baxter had followed basic journalism ethics, and the amount of attention that Buster got was a ton, considering he’s just 8 years old. Nobody was set up for success here on what really was Buster being in the right place at the right time (which he even admitted).

 <b>Season 2 Episode 6b</b>
 <br>
 <br>To me, this episode is a classic case of Mr.<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/T59Qeix.gif"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> and Mrs. Read not having house rules about things like loud music and letting it get out of hand. Like how does Mrs. Read, an accountant who probably spends most of her day looking at spreadsheets, concentrate on her work with Crazy Bus playing nonstop? Mr. Read is lucky that he works primarily in his kitchen, but even he needs earplugs to concentrate because D.W. is playing the music so loudly. But you can’t accuse them completely of not being fair: since they all went to Bionic Bunny on Ice with Arthur, it’s only fair that they went to Crazy Bus Live with D.W. Fair and square, sometimes one has to hold their nose and do something they don’t want to do in exchange for having everyone else do what they want to do. I will say that the animation in this is very good, especially with the breakfast scene where the music causes ripples in Arthur’s cereal and juice. That music must’ve been loud, and I mean LOUD.
 <br>
 <br>The whole saga of the CD disappearing is interesting to say the least. It may seem logical for Arthur to want to at least hide it so that he can have some peace and quiet, but it’s ironic that it was Mr. and Mrs. Read, who really enabled D.W. when it comes to Crazy Bus, who took the CD and put it in the case of an album “Songs You Can’t Believe You Liked” from 1978, to boot. (I did some research and Billboard’s No. 1 for that year was “Shadow Dancing,” by Andy Gibb, with “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees clocking in at No. 4). But again, when Catherine is babysitting, she totally takes a both-sides approach towards D.W. doing everything it takes to find her CD. Even at the end after Mrs. Read halfheartedly tells D.W. to not bother others with it, the grown-ups can’t stop enabling D.W, as Grandma Thora gets her the VHS of Crazy Bus: The Motion Picture. It probably isn’t much more than the song with animation. 
 <br>
 <br>To wrap it up, this episode has many funny moments, but also could’ve-been’s for Mr. and Mrs. Read in terms of avoiding chaos.

 <b>Season 2 Episode 10a</b>
 <br>
 <br>The episodes where someone goes on vacation never seem<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/H72QDDX.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> to disappoint and this one is no exception as the Reads hit the road for the American capital. However, that does not come before D.W. makes her desire to go to Ponyland known. I would’ve loved more of a backstory on Santa’s Igloo, where D.W. had seen on TV and where the family had gone but turned out to be a total bust (also I wish there was an episode where D.W. gets her wish of going to Ponyland and Arthur has to tag along, just for the heck of it). As a lifelong DC area resident, I’ve never experienced a DC where one can just walk right up to the White House or Capitol and get a tour that same day–that changed after 9/11, so this gives us a glimpse of what it was like (I have taken tours of both, arranged through my grandfather’s members of Congress, which is how one goes about getting those tours these days). Maybe this is the older sibling bias coming in, but watching this now, I got tired of D.W.’s constant badgering of everyone about ponies at every turn. That said, some of her lines in this episode are both iconic and relatable, like “This government is too complicated, no wonder Daddy is always complaining about it,” and “I don’t care about the president, I care about ponies!” Sadly, that apathy is all too common nowadays.
<br>
<br>While the end of the episode could never happen in reality, it is funny how D.W. just stumbles across the president (presumably Bill Clinton) and doesn’t even realize it was him and thinks he’s just a tour guide. And some of the interactions involving the Secret Service agents are also memorable (“Bundle recovered, ducks in a row, peas in a pod.” “What?” “We found D.W.” “Who lost a duck?”). Overall, one of my all-time favorite episodes, a throwback to days of yore in DC–a reminder of what things used to be like and a stark contrast to what we’ve seen transpire there as of late..
