 <b>Season 2 Episode 10a</b>
 <br>
 <br>The episodes where someone goes on vacation never seem<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/H72QDDX.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> to disappoint and this one is no exception as the Reads hit the road for the American capital. However, that does not come before D.W. makes her desire to go to Ponyland known. I would’ve loved more of a backstory on Santa’s Igloo, where D.W. had seen on TV and where the family had gone but turned out to be a total bust (also I wish there was an episode where D.W. gets her wish of going to Ponyland and Arthur has to tag along, just for the heck of it). As a lifelong DC area resident, I’ve never experienced a DC where one can just walk right up to the White House or Capitol and get a tour that same day–that changed after 9/11, so this gives us a glimpse of what it was like (I have taken tours of both, arranged through my grandfather’s members of Congress, which is how one goes about getting those tours these days). Maybe this is the older sibling bias coming in, but watching this now, I got tired of D.W.’s constant badgering of everyone about ponies at every turn. That said, some of her lines in this episode are both iconic and relatable, like “This government is too complicated, no wonder Daddy is always complaining about it,” and “I don’t care about the president, I care about ponies!” Sadly, that apathy is all too common nowadays.
<br>
<br>While the end of the episode could never happen in reality, it is funny how D.W. just stumbles across the president (presumably Bill Clinton) and doesn’t even realize it was him and thinks he’s just a tour guide. And some of the interactions involving the Secret Service agents are also memorable (“Bundle recovered, ducks in a row, peas in a pod.” “What?” “We found D.W.” “Who lost a duck?”). Overall, one of my all-time favorite episodes, a throwback to days of yore in DC–a reminder of what things used to be like and a stark contrast to what we’ve seen transpire there as of late..
