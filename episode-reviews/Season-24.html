 <b>Season 24 Episode 3a</b>
 <br>
 <br>Of Couse, a preschooler-centric episode that focuses<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/4tbnvhf.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> on D.W. and her preschool pals. Sometimes these episodes are very enjoyable, even for older viewers, and become classics in the series. Sadly, this episode was a huge swing and a miss for the Arthur team. We do get an interesting perspective  of D.W. and Bud attending some sort of summer camp or craft class at the community center, which I do not think we have seen in the series up until this point. The set up was promising, with D.W. meeting the teacher Hana, but truly seemed to turn into a very dull episode.
<br>
<br> Most of this episode takes place in the craft room while the kids were making puppets. During this time, we slowly see D.W. turning into Hana whom she idolizes a lot, saying "fierce," and changing her style of clothing. Really did not mind this message of idolizing Hana, but wasn't too crazy about it. What I did like, and would have prefered to see more of, was the slow deterioration of friendship between D.W. and Bud. This secondary plot was in there, but wasn't really focused on too much throughout the episode. 
<br>
<br>The ending of this episode really suprised me and left me very confused on what the overall moral was. Katinka Mink, Hana's favorite singer, is coming to Elwood City for her <i>Scapes of Paper Tour</i>. D.W. just assumes that she would go to the concert with Hana and her other teenage friends. When Hana tells her she would not like it and it was for older kids, D.W. starts to sing this song titled "You're Wrong." I wasn't too crazy about this song, but it wasn't bad, It just felt very out of place to me. Also I was very confused when Hana apologized at the end for not inviting her, as I thought Hana's answer was completely justified. I mean, would it be appropriate for a 4 year old to attend a concert with some teenage girls who are doing who knows waht? Of course not. 
<br>
<br>After viewing this episode numerous times, I think I have found that the main moral is to be friends with people who are your age, and not to grow up too fast. However, I think this episode conveyed the message in a very clunky way. The Arthur writers are usually very good at putting out episodes that connect with the viewer right away, and have an interesting plot as well. This has neither.

 <b>Season 24 Episode 3b</b>
 <br>
 <br>"Oh No," is exactly what I said when I read the episode<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/oUhY0d0.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">  description and saw that Arthur was doing a parody of <i>Freaky Friday</i>. Therefore I buckled up, and came in with very low expectations for this episode. But just maybe, the preconcieved ideas pushed me to see out the beauty of this episode. As Arthur and the class take their test, Mr. Ratburn has to go to the teacher's lounge.  Buster then goes to find him because he broke his pencil, and if we connect back to the episode "Buster the Lounge Lizard," he finally gets to visit it in this episode. Anyhow, while in the lounge, Mr. Ratburn and Buster touch a tray at the same time to induce an electron transfer. The tray of food was spanakopita cooked by lightning. Really loved the choice of using spanakopita as the food, as it is a very fun word that is said throughout the episode and a great dish!
<br>
<br> The best part of the episode starts here after Mr. Ratburn and Buster switch bodies. It is very funny to see Buster talk with Ratburn's voice and Ratburn with Busters. To fix this Buster (in Ratburn's body) needs to go and teach the class, while Ratburn (in Buster's body) must find a way to reverse the effect of the electron transfer. Buster's then goes to the classroom, which is very funny and awkward, and must find a lesson plan. He decides to teach about Ancient Egypt by role playing. This leads to the students fanning Buster (who is the Pharaoh or "Sparrow" as he says), and stacking the desks into Pyramids. I loved Buster's hilarious teaching, as well as his absurd grading system.
<br>
<br>While Buster is teaching, Ratburn is off trying to reverse the switch, while keeping away from Mrs. Tingley. This chase was very entertaining, as well as thrilling. The one thing that confused me in this episode was when Mr. Ratburn ran into the man who cooked the spanakopita, and that was Mr. Ranbacher. He is supposedly the 8th grade science teacher, but why is there an 8th grade in an elementary school. The ending was a little predicatble, as it was a dream, but it did bring us into Buster's mind for about 11 minutes.
