 <b>Season 3 Episode 5a & b</b>
 <br>
 <br> Without saying anything else, the plotline of “The Chips Are Down” could not be written otherwise; it’s just too good. Arthur and Buster’s fearmongering about green potato chips leads to maybe<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/KMbsX0U.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> the most improbable friendship between D.W. and Binky, better known as “Big Head Kid'' in this episode. But it also leads to Binky stepping out of his comfort zone and starting to take ballet, and both of them taking it upon themselves to not fritter away their lives. Good messaging here. The hands down best interaction of “The Chips Are Down” is when Binky explains to Mr. Ratburn and Mr. Haney exactly why he blew off his homework, inspiring “Herb” to go climb Mount Everest. The dumbfounded look on Mr. Ratburn’s face after that–priceless. Also, at the end of the episode Binky talks about wanting to write his own ballet called “Robot Man in the Junkyard''–I would love to see an episode where that actually materializes. (I also think that in the “A Word from Us Kids'' between episodes, it’s great that someone involved in the making of potato chips explained that eating just one green potato chip will not hurt you).
<br>
<br>It seems clear that D.W. wanted to put this whole thing behind her, as we see in “Revenge of the Chip,” to the point that she was taking out books from the library about macroeconomics to come off as more grown up (and wanting her parents to read it to her as a bedtime story). As someone who had to take macroeconomics in college, I guarantee that she would fall asleep within minutes upon hearing about GDP and inflation. But the main point is, she may have moved on from it, but the rest of Elwood City didn’t, and we have D.W.’s own mom to thank for that. I think that in many of the early episodes, Mr. and Mrs. Read are shown with an air of infallibility about them, but this is more than just making a mistake: it’s Mrs. Read breaking trust D.W. had in her. To her credit, she apologizes, and to Arthur’s credit, him and his friends let D.W. go to the live taping of Kids Do The Most Embarrassing Things. But both episodes are a cautionary tale of why people shouldn’t believe everything they hear, why even supposedly wise parents aren’t infallible, and how unlikely friendships can form in weird situations.
