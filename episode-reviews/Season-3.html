 <b>Season 3 Episode 1a</b>
 <br>
 <br> Season 3 starts out with the resumption of “Arthur’s Faraway Friend,” but not before one of the creepier opens of the series. Arthur does say that it was his dream that night before, but it seems like something Buster would dream to me–Arthur comes across as a much more rational dreamer. But back to the show–Arthur’s reaction to Mrs. Baxter telling him that Buster would be home that day will be my exact reaction when me and all of my friends get the COVID vaccine and it’s safe to see them again. The element of surprise<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/gGf1I0U.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">  is just as big here too, since as I mentioned in my “Arthur’s Faraway Friend” review, they probably only communicated by snail mail and maybe the occasional telephone call while he was away.
<br>
<br>That also could be a reason why Arthur thought Buster might act strange when he came home (although the fearmongering from D.W., Francine et al definitely didn’t help). Francine said something I heard from many of my friends after they came back from study abroad: “They came back a different person” (as cringeworthy and cliché as that saying is). Those fantasies of Buster becoming a race car driver, sumo wrestler, cowboy and elephant rider are admittedly funny though. Kudos to Arthur though for trying to learn about the places Buster went, albeit in short order. If they had a better means of keeping up, maybe he wouldn't have had to cram for his reunion with Buster. But as it turns out, Buster was also waiting to get back to Arthur.
<br>
<br>I think that "The Ballad of Buster Baxter" is better as far as conveying the mood about Buster coming back, and has far more memorable moments than this. But it is nice to see them reunited and doing what Buster wanted to do all along: play checkers and eat cake.

 <b>Season 3 Episode 1b</b>
 <br>
 <br> He gave us hits like “April, Come She Will,” “The Boxer,” and “Mrs. Robinson,” and now the one and only Art Garfunkel gave us the Ballad of Buster Baxter. The rendering of him as a moose was spot-on in my opinion, and some of his lyrics throughout the show are legendary. Especially the “Sad Sad Bunny” thing where Buster<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/fYVVhdR.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> tells Art Garfunkel to play that in more of a minor key. He's one of those celebrities where I always see him as his depiction on the show as a moose, rather than his actual person, and imagine that when I listen to his music. Just like Yo-Yo Ma, Mr. Rogers et al.
<br>
<br>This is the continuation of “Buster’s Back,” and you really do feel bad for Buster at times throughout this. While it is probably forgivable that the kids got into the Kresblain movies while Buster was gone (like kids do with trends like that), it wasn’t right for Arthur to try and lie and say that they had seen Carpet of Doom, and then use that as a reason to leave him out. And maybe Arthur and the Brain could’ve held off on continuing their book while they were gone. The party though was a big miss on everybody’s part, and it wouldn’t have taken the Brain weighing the facts using logical conclusions to figure out that nobody invited Buster (Yes Binky, that’s why he wasn’t there). Nonetheless though, they get it right at the end, and we do see the same old Buster as they get together to watch his travel slides as he pigs out on popcorn. The episode ends with one of the most iconic lines of the entire series from Arthur: “Mom! There’s a singing moose in front of the house!”
<br>
<br>Easily one of the best episodes of the entire series for me, and the song (with an extra verse in there too!) is on the first CD. I wish there was somewhere where we can hear the other lyrics from Art Garfunkel.
<br>
 <br><i>“This is the next day, that’s all I have to say, hey!”
 <br>
 <br>“Kresblamania, it’s insania
 <br>How did Arthur catch/Buster NOT catch Kresblamania?”
 <br>
 <br>“That’s how it happened, you can see
 <br>With Buster and the kids in Elwood City
 <br>Now you know you’re close friends
 <br>You can always get back together again”</i>

 <b>Season 3 Episode 5a & b</b>
 <br>
 <br> Without saying anything else, the plotline of “The Chips Are Down” could not be written otherwise; it’s just too good. Arthur and Buster’s fearmongering about green potato chips leads to maybe<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/KMbsX0U.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> the most improbable friendship between D.W. and Binky, better known as “Big Head Kid'' in this episode. But it also leads to Binky stepping out of his comfort zone and starting to take ballet, and both of them taking it upon themselves to not fritter away their lives. Good messaging here. The hands down best interaction of “The Chips Are Down” is when Binky explains to Mr. Ratburn and Mr. Haney exactly why he blew off his homework, inspiring “Herb” to go climb Mount Everest. The dumbfounded look on Mr. Ratburn’s face after that–priceless. Also, at the end of the episode Binky talks about wanting to write his own ballet called “Robot Man in the Junkyard''–I would love to see an episode where that actually materializes. (I also think that in the “A Word from Us Kids'' between episodes, it’s great that someone involved in the making of potato chips explained that eating just one green potato chip will not hurt you).
<br>
<br>It seems clear that D.W. wanted to put this whole thing behind her, as we see in “Revenge of the Chip,” to the point that she was taking out books from the library about macroeconomics to come off as more grown up (and wanting her parents to read it to her as a bedtime story). As someone who had to take macroeconomics in college, I guarantee that she would fall asleep within minutes upon hearing about GDP and inflation. But the main point is, she may have moved on from it, but the rest of Elwood City didn’t, and we have D.W.’s own mom to thank for that. I think that in many of the early episodes, Mr. and Mrs. Read are shown with an air of infallibility about them, but this is more than just making a mistake: it’s Mrs. Read breaking trust D.W. had in her. To her credit, she apologizes, and to Arthur’s credit, him and his friends let D.W. go to the live taping of Kids Do The Most Embarrassing Things. But both episodes are a cautionary tale of why people shouldn’t believe everything they hear, why even supposedly wise parents aren’t infallible, and how unlikely friendships can form in weird situations.
