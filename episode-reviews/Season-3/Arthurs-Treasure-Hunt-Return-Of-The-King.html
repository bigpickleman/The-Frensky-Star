 <b>Season 3 Episode 9a</b>
 <br>
 <br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/d49Xx1q.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">Sticking with the theme of inventions, the comparison that Arthur makes of himself to Galileo or Sir Isaac Newton is a lot like that in “Arthur the Wrecker” back in Season 1–both of them just aren’t very apt. With that being said, I’m definitely in favor of the kids digging things up–especially Buster finding an arrowhead which could have been useful in finding out the Indigenous history of the area (maybe Ranger Ruth from "Dinosaur Dilemma" might have leads on that). Clearly, the area where the Brain lives used to be a metal detector factory, because he sure found a lot of those in his yard, and in Muffy's case, just who has a butler that can go into a diamond mine (probably far, far away from Elwood City) to bring diamonds on demand? Credit to Binky though for being creative even though all he found was roots–long live Angua the iguana. 
 <br>
 <br>The fantasies in this one are some of the best, with Arthur finding tunnels that lead to Buster’s closet and Arthur utilizing another to buy charcoal for a barbecue. “It’s a good thing you didn’t listen to me,” is a funny thing to imagine Mrs. Read saying and even funnier to hear her actually say it. But as the other saying goes, be careful what you wish for, because the results of everyone’s treasure hunt were underwhelming to say the least. Unless you consider old sippy cups, pennies, digestive biscuits that are most likely inedible after probably 20+ years in the ground, and roots in the shape of an iguana exciting. And it was even more underwhelming because Arthur dug up the entire yard to basically find nothing and had to clean the whole garage. Chances are, if you think that one or both of your parents will be happy that you didn’t listen to them, what you’re about to do is something they wouldn’t approve of. 
 <br>
 <br>Nice try, Arthur, but you kind of deserved whatever punishment came to you here.

 <b>Season 3 Episode 9b</b>
 <br>
 <br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/boPB0jn.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">Another one of my all-time favorites shows Lakewood Elementary up against Glenbrook at the medieval fair, but really a grudge match between Mr. Ratburn and his teacher, Mr. Pryce-Jones. The seemingly parallel universe between the kids from the schools is striking, especially the doppelgangers of all the Lakewood kids who compete against them in the games. But of course,  they acted very differently as prep school students. If this was a competition as to how good the kids were at the medieval games, it really would be no competition because in a public school, one doesn't learn how to live and breathe the Middle Ages. Something tells me Mr. Ratburn never taught his students how to navigate a maze using the sun and tops of the trees. But in the other games, some of the Glenbrook kids are just plain rude, like in the archery competition where Francine’s competitor licks the arrow (gross) to knock hers out of the middle. I barely knew Newton’s formula for constant acceleration as a senior in high school taking physics, but Mr. Pryce-Jones scolded Mr. Ratburn for not teaching it to his students in third grade. 
 <br>
 <br>I don’t know of any place where two schools square off against each other in a medieval fair–especially a private school where there may be more emphasis on that type of instruction and a public school where that probably isn’t taught in as much depth. Of course Mr. Ratburn hadn’t taught the Lakewood kids the long song that’s more historical than musical about the kings of England in the order categorical (I watched this recently and for some reason started cracking up at that). Or trivia where to get the correct answer, you need to give what the answer would be in the Middle Ages. But the arrogance that Mr. Pryce-Jones and the Glenbrook kids show quickly gets shot when Arthur goes slow, gentle and steady to successfully pull out the sword from the stone, enough for Mr. Pryce-Jones to be taken aback and kind of humbled for the first time. And good news for the Lakewood kids–Mr. Pryce-Jones won’t be teaching them instead of Mr. Ratburn, but Mr. Haney’s niece and nephew didn’t look too thrilled about being tutored by him. But hey, they’ll definitely be well-versed in the English kings! 
 <br>
 <br>Mr. Pryce-Jones and his students may have won most of the games at the fair, but there’s no doubt that the Lakewood kids got a lot out of the day, and Arthur especially, going home as king of the medieval fair.
