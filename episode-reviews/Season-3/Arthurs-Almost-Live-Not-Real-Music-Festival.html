 <b>Season 3 Episode 11b</b>
 <br>
 <br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/RDGpuyb.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">Definitely a unique episode, as there really isn’t any plot other than Arthur and Buster performing. At the start, D.W. mistakes the two of them beatboxing and scatting (á la Bobby McFerrin) for some weird noise in the house, and tracks them down in the basement with a very creative setup that they use to bring us some classics. 
<br>
<br>For me, the #1 song from this is “Library Card,” which we hear a verse or so at a time throughout. It showcases how libraries aren’t just buildings with lots of books at them: they are also places where there can be cool events (as we see in several episodes with Mr. Ratburn’s puppet shows and the Joshua Redman/Yo-Yo Ma collab), and community events in general. It’s an interesting segway from that to “Jekyll and Hyde,” which honestly creeped me out when I was younger. To this day, I still don’t really know why they put that in there. On the other hand, though, “Homework” is a classic from this. Mr. Ratburn’s acapella song about all the homework he’s assigning the kids is really good, and on the CD, there’s an extra verse in there.
<br>
<br><i>“Write about global warming for extra credit (Buster: ‘Global what’)
<br>Check the spelling, don’t forget to edit!
<br>Tomorrow’s going to be another day
<br>That’s when you get to hear me say
<br>Just a little homework tonight…”</i>
<br>
<br>While “Library Card” is the top song of this for me, “Leftovers Goulash” comes in at a close second. Any chance Arthur might have given his dad in a prior episode goes out the door, and we get a list of all the disgusting-sounding things he makes set to the Hungarian Rhapsody and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Jellyfish inside a beet, garlic eels, custard soup, liver cake, curry pie with prunes and squash (a curry pie is actually a real thing, popular in the UK, but without the prunes and squash) don’t sound appetizing in the slightest. No wonder Arthur and D.W. say that they’re not hungry anymore at the end of this.
<br>
<br>But we end on “Library Card," and it's especially poignant in this day and age, where there's seemingly a paywall for everything. Libraries are places where one can borrow a book, get on the Internet, or take part in other community activities for free. I've heard people say that one of the first buildings in a community that would be rebuilt after a natural disaster is a library, because of its value and importance. The last lyric of the song is the million-dollar question of the episode: "WHO IS DEWEY???!!!" All these songs and more are available on the CD bearing the same name as the episode, which I'll review in the future.
