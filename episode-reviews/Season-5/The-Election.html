 <b>Season 5 Episode 6a</b>
 <br>
 <br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/IkN1XFI.png"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">
Ahh, the old-fashioned mock election at school. We did this when I was in elementary school (albeit with made-up names of the candidates), and we had elections for each class’s representatives in the student council throughout my grade school years with very little controversy. The only real consequential one was for my junior class officers because they were in charge of planning prom. Student body elections in college, though, were a whole other story. Three of the four years, there was some controversy. One year, the frontrunner was disqualified for members of her campaign team allegedly stalking an opponent. The next year, a VP candidate’s past derogatory comments on social media were resurfaced, which tanked his campaign. And then what happened the year after that is very similar to what happens in this episode.
 <br>
 <br>100% of the controversy in this episode, however, is caused by Muffy taking a third-grade class mock election way too seriously. Nobody makes buttons and muffins to hand out for one of those (especially when she was giving them to people who wouldn’t even be voting in Mr. Ratburn’s class). And Muffy overreacted to Binky deciding to enter the election as a write-in, which is where my college years come in. During my junior year, somebody entered the student government elections as a write-in on the sole platform of abolishing the student government, and he forced a runoff, where he ultimately lost in a landslide (with the eventual winner getting 66.6% of the vote), but not before becoming a meme (or laughingstock) on campus. 
 <br>
 <br>Usually in an election, a third-party candidate siphons votes from one major candidate and often swings the election in favor of the other, making the third-party candidate a spoiler. But that’s not what happened here. Clearly, the platform of snacks in class all the time, wrestling on TV in class, and one no-questions-asked excused absence per week resonated with the kids. But this was just a mock election, which clearly was lost on Binky. He didn’t even seem to really want to run until he complained about Arthur and Muffy’s platforms being too boring. Ironically, just weeks after this episode first aired, we had one of the most controversial (and consequential) elections in American history. Foreshadowing?
