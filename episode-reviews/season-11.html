 <b>Season 11 Episode 7a</b>
 <br> 
I thought that it would be fitting to do a review of this Halloween <i>Arthur episode</i>, seeing as it's Halloween and PBS has played it like a bazillion times the past two weeks. I also remembered enjoying Halloween morning, when I watched this Arthur episode every year!<img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/UR35uUD.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> As we begin, we have this cold open that always annoys me when I watch it. This is mainly because I completely disagree with Arthur on the point of Halloween. He says that you are supposed to be something scary on Halloween, this actually really bugs me because I never dressed up as anything scary on Halloween. At the end of the cold open, Arthur tries to scare D.W. and she just laughs. Looks like he just broke his own Halloween rule. Also here is another Arthur episode with someone wearing a mask! Great job by Arthur encouraging people to wear a mask 15+ years before Covid. Now getting into the episode proper, we start out by seeing Arthur and the gang's costumes. I really enjoyed the weird and strange Halloween costumes they all had. Also I was a bit suprised, but I really loved the Brain's joke at the end about him dressing up as the 14th century. He is normally a character I find annoying, but he really worked well throughout this episode. The writers also did a great job introducing Halloween at the beginning, but not making it the focal point of the episode. We then get introduced to D.W.'s hiccuping problem, when she is following Arthur around trying to tell him some scary Halloween costumes. D.W. I found very funny with her costume ideas and carried on her hilarity throughout the episode. Then Arthur reads D.W.'s absurd list on what she thinks is scary, which is another comedic moment. Then there is the montage where D.W. is being scared, which is another strong point in the episode. This goes south for the idea of them solving D.W.'s hiccups. We also get another good Brain moment where he brings up some trivia about the longest hiccups case ever. I like when <i>Arthur</i> adds some inciteful trivia. Finally, towards the end of the episode we get to the trick-or-treating. I love Mr. Read's sandwich costume in this scene, as it makes me laugh everytime! The one thing I was very confused about was how Mrs. Read asked about what D.W.'s costume was. If you have a 4 year old daughter, shouldn't you have bought them a costume and helped them put it on? I mean you can't just tell D.W. to go to the store and get a costume herself. After this little scene, the lights go out and Arthur comes down the stairs and freaks out D.W. with his Frankentist costume. I found this climax of the episode to be a little dull, because in the very beginning D.W. told Arthur how un-scary his costume was. I can see where the writers were going, as Arthur might look different in the dark without glasses, but I think it was a little unbelievable. At the end Arthur finds a little pride in the fact that D.W said his costume was scary, so he tries to scare other trick-or-treaters; And all he gets are laughs. This was a great little ending to sum the episode up.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 Overall not a bad episode, but not an extremely great one either. I think that I looked forward to watching this episode more when it was the only Halloween episode. Now it has been overshaddowed and eclipsed by ones like <i>Arthur & the Haunted Treehouse</i>. But I can't say this isn't a must watch during Halloween, because it is.
