 <b>Season 1 Episode 25a</b>
<br>
<br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/82vePO9.png"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">It’s wedding day in Elwood City as Aunt Lucy is getting set to tie the knot. Just like in “Arthur’s Baby,” we see everyone else (except Cousin Cora of course) a bit more subdued with their enthusiasm about a big life event, while D.W. is more excited than the rest, even going as far as marrying the toaster and blender. But that excitement is not rewarded with an actual role of note in the wedding. And on top of that, Arthur, Cora and everyone else kind of rubs that in, albeit kind of subtly. Again, we see in “Big Brother Binky” that Mrs. Barnes gives Binky a role in the build-up to their trip to China–the Reads don’t do that for D.W. here. 
<br>
<br>Wedding day itself is one that nobody involved will ever forget. D.W. crashing the wedding photo was a funny moment, especially when she asks to be involved next time Aunt Lucy gets married (also, Arthur Holden as the voice of the photographer makes it funnier–sometimes if I have the episode on in the background, I think it’s Mr. Ratburn moonlighting as the photographer). During the procession, Cora doesn’t just toss the flowers at the crowd: she pelts the audience with them, which is very on brand. But also I can’t think about what threw Arthur off so much so that caused him to launch the wedding ring up and into the organ pipe–that had some serious hangtime before it went very precisely down the pipe. Grandpa Dave getting his fingers stuck in the pipes is also very on brand, but you have to hand it to D.W. for going in there with all those spiders and dust to get it. And Arthur was a very good brother in letting D.W. carry the ring once the ceremony got started again. 
<br>
<br>Everyone goes home happy–except Cora, of course. Kind of what she deserves for rubbing it in earlier, but it’s not like she was being 100% relieved of her flower girl duties. Still, D.W. got what she wanted, which was being a part of her aunt’s big day. When everyone looks back on this wedding years down the road, that is the part of it they’ll remember the most.
