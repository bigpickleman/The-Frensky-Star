 <b>Season 1 Episode 7b</b>
<br>
<br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/irh98rS.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">The open to this is clever, with Arthur speaking in literal terms to describe Buster’s habits. For him, staying on top of his work means sleeping on a pile of books, and bouncing ideas off friends involves…doing just that. That’s not a recipe for success in Mr. Ratburn’s class, as Buster will soon find out, as could anyone from watching the show. With that being said though, it seems crazy to me that Mr. Ratburn didn’t offer Buster any help and just threatened to hold him back (and called both his mom and grandmother in, to boot). Threatening to hold kids back without actually trying to help them succeed is just wrong, and it shouldn’t be on a third grader to figure that out on their own. Buster clearly had issues focusing on the work, something not even tying him to a tree can fix. 
<br>
<br>With all that being said, Arthur’s friends could’ve just left Buster on his own to fend for himself, but they did what friends should do–help him out. It is kind of ironic that while Binky is talking about the benefits of a tutor, he’s doing so while at the arcade, and when it’s his turn to help Buster study, he does probably the least effective thing of anyone–tying him to a tree and reading to him. Even methods that seemed like they would work, like using candies to teach division and getting outside to study, didn’t work, but that’s not the fault of Buster’s friends–they are not professional tutors, which is what he needed. While Buster does eventually pull it together and cram the night before, that may be sending the wrong message about cramming (I never pulled an all-nighter in college and I’m very proud of that). 
<br>
<br>And also, it should never have come to where he needed a certain grade on the year-end test to make it to fourth grade, because Mr. Ratburn and other people at the school should’ve been there for him when he started struggling, not when he was in danger of being held back.
