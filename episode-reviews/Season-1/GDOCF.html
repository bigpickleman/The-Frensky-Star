 <b>Season 1 Episode 15b</b>
<br>
<br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/svvJd8B.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right"> This is a fitting second half to the doubleheader with “Arthur’s Family Vacation” starting it off, as it covers a different type of vacation: a week at Grandpa Dave’s. While we don’t know exactly what it’s modeled after, his farm looks like it could be in the Poconos somewhere, possibly modeled after some place where Marc Brown spent summers as a kid. In other shows I’ve seen the prospect of a week at Grandpa’s be leveraged as punishment for kids acting up, but Arthur and D.W. take this in stride and seem to be excited about it. I think they appreciate getting away from the hustle and bustle of Elwood City to where one can swim in the lake, go on hikes, and enjoy the county fair. But as we see, they didn’t do a ton of that on this trip.
<br>
<br>The main idea of the episode is that grandparents often need support with a lot of things. When Grandpa Dave inherited that family farm, he probably was much younger and could maintain the place without much help. But now that he’s older, the farm has clearly fallen into disrepair, and one of the most glaring signs of that was the henhouse breaking down, which caused him to put the chickens in a guestroom. It is interesting how that was what caused Arthur and D.W. to want to help rebuild the henhouse, but I would not have wanted to sleep in the same room as a bunch of chickens. Sometimes, it can be hard to accept that you can’t keep something maintained alone, and clearly Grandpa Dave had that stubbornness about him. His friend Ed knew that better than anyone else, it seemed. 
<br>
<br>While Arthur and D.W. definitely shouldn’t have felt like they had to work during their vacation, it ultimately helped Grandpa Dave realize that he couldn’t do it all on his own. D.W. reminding him of that was big in making him realize that the family farm meant that it was in their whole family, and they were right in wanting to help maintain the place, undoubtedly so that future generations could be proud of it. Also, every senior citizen should have a friend like Ed in their lives.
