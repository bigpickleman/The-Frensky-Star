 <b>Season 1 Episode 7a</b>
<br>
<br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/L2UMqlM.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">Ahh, summer camp, the time-honored tradition of parents dumping their kids somewhere each day (or in this case for an entire week) and the kids often being less than happy about it. While I did plenty of basketball camps when I was in my pre-teens/early teens, I never did those sleepaway camps with all the stuff in nature. But I do know that there are lots of those camps up in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, so it would make sense that maybe this was inspired by something Marc Brown was a part of when he was a young kid. 
<br>
<br>The names “Camp Meadowcroak” and “Camp Horsewater” are very clever and a good play on words with something (When I wrote this, “Meadowcreek” was suggested for me by the computer). Although none of the Horsewater kids are named, a few of the Tough Customers are at that camp, including Molly and that brown dog who is unnamed. But the Meadowcroak kids at first are occupied with the boys vs. girls rivalry, which Binky prepared for despite his first prank attempt failing miserably on the bus and the girls getting win after win at the camp. As we see, however, it is the Horsewater Tough Customers who are antagonizing their younger counterparts. 
<br>
<br>It is weird though how Meadowcroak and Horsewater compete against each other in the scavenger hunt despite the obvious age difference. Not the fairest competition there by any stretch. But while Horsewater had the physical might, Arthur and the Meadowcroak kids had the mental edge with their plan. You would have to be REALLY gullible to believe that Brain dressed in a fur coat (where one can still see his legs and he’s still standing upright) is an actual bear, and Horsewater fell for it big time. It also was good writing that the postcard, which Arthur wasn’t too thrilled about bringing to camp and writing to his parents all the time, was the item that won the scavenger hunt for him and the rest of the Meadowcroak kids. As Ashley Tisdale sings in the first High School Musical, they arrived because they stuck together.
