 <b>Season 1 Episode 25b</b>
<br>
<br><img class="wrap" src="https://i.imgur.com/Kk14wkT.png?1"  width="500" height="300" position="right" style="float:right">The main plotline of this episode may be that Mr. Read gets Arthur involved with something, but really, it’s a commentary on the issue of climate change and keeping the Earth healthy. While the genesis of Arthur’s idea is that World’s End Park is becoming littered too much, we mustn’t forget that climate change is being made worse by corporations and politicians that are beholden to those corporations. That said, local communities can do their part in keeping the earth clean and that’s what Mr. Read challenges Arthur to do here. It’s clear that nobody had thought about the ramifications of littering in the park, so large-scale community action was needed here. 
<br>
<br>I would be unmoved at the prospect of joining something called the “Kids Clean-Up Brigade,” so it’s kind of hard to blame Arthur for not being super gung-ho about that. That said, my town has a “Village Preservation Society” which focuses on sustainability and keeping the city clean, and something along those lines sound way more appealing to join. As we see later in this season with “My Dad, the Garbage Man,” however, once Arthur gets a tour of the sanitation department from Mr. Frensky, he gets a much greater idea of what it’s all about, that sanitation is way more than just driving a garbage truck around once a week. 
<br>
<br>But the most important part of this is that it takes a village to keep it clean. Arthur couldn’t keep the park completely clean on his own, as the simulation that he saw at the sanitation department saw–he needed a team of volunteers. And also we see the consequences of so much trash getting littered on pets, as Pal almost chokes, thanks to the Tough Customers intentionally deciding to litter. Watching that in the year 2022, it totally feels like a metaphor for how large corporations’ actions of waste and abuse (and politicians’ inaction at stopping that) can literally choke people. Eventually, the rest of the crew decides to pitch in, and for their sake, hopefully this “Kids Clean-Up Brigade” will turn into something with a better name, like the aforementioned “Village
